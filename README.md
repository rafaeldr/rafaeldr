Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rafael!
========================

Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science
-----------------------------------

- ðŸ”­ I was born in SÃ£o JoÃ£o da Boa Vista, SP, Brazil, in 1987. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science from SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP, Rio Claro) in 2008, my M.Sc. in Applied Computing from the University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2018, and my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC-USP, Capes 7) in 2025.

I have over five years of professional experience in the software development industry â€” including large-scale projects for banks and franchise networks â€” and over 20 years of software development experience when considering my academic work. My career also includes teaching experience at the Federal Institute of SÃ£o Paulo (IFSP) and a strong track record of interdisciplinary collaboration in research, particularly in psychophysics and eye-tracking.

My doctoral research combines mathematical modeling and computational simulations using complex networks and AI models to investigate how the structural organization of neural networks influences time perception. I have contributed to scientific publications and serve as a reviewer for high-impact international journals.

I aim to apply my expertise in contexts that demand complex systems analysis, artificial intelligence, and data-driven solutions, whether in applied research or strategic high-impact projects.

- ðŸ”¬ Research interests: Artificial Intelligence, Complex Networks, Computational Neuroscience, Modeling and Simulation, Dynamic Systems Analysis, Applied Science in Technology.
